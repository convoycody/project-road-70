# Roadmap (Grounded in existing rules)

## Now (stabilization)
- Verify iPhone Safari permissions (motion sensors + location) and Start/Stop gating
- Verify 60s bucket aggregation and local confidence computation
- Verify server ingest -> storage -> admin visibility
- Verify geocode backfill + score recompute endpoints

## Next (planned, not implemented here)
- User rewards points system (requires login + persistent identity)
- User login to track logged points
- Expanded metrics and scoring (while preserving privacy-first aggregate-only upload)
