# Roadmap (Project Road 70)

This file is the short, root-level summary. The detailed roadmap lives in
`docs/ROADMAP.md`.

## Now (stabilization)
- Confirm iPhone Safari permissions (motion sensors + location) and Start/Stop gating.
- Validate ingest pipeline: client aggregation → server storage → admin visibility.
- Verify geocode backfill + score recompute + event detection pipelines.

## Next (near-term)
- Reward points: user login + persistent identity + points balance.
- Expand scoring analytics and anomaly/event reporting with admin visibility.

## Later
- Public map views and segment insights backed by recent rollups.
- Export/reporting endpoints for partner or municipal use.
